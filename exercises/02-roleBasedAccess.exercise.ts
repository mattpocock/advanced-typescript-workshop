/**

 * ⛔️ Guess who's back:
 *
 * Argument of type '"update-self" | "view" | "create" | "update-any"

 *
 * To understand this error, we will have to dig pretty deep.
 *
 * 🚁 Let's look at our UserAccessModelValues type again.
 *
 * This type is a union of readonly arrays. Some of those arrays
 * contain values that aren't present in the others. For instance,
 * "anonymous" only contains "view", but "admin" has "delete".
 *
 * When we call .includes, we're calling it on userAccessModel[role] -
 * which is exactly the same type as UserAccessModelValues.
 *
 * 🕵️‍♂️ Refactor the function so that it saves userAccessModel[role]
 * into its own variable before calling includes on it.
 *
 * const possibleActions = userAccessModel[role];
 *       ^ 🚁
 * return possibleActions.includes(action);
 *
 * 🚁 Hover over possibleActions. It should be the same type
 * as UserAccessModelValues.
 *
 * Now that we've confirmed this, we need to look at the type
 * definition for .includes to understand what might be happening
 * there.

 * 💡 OK, we've now learned that the error is something to do with
